## **Objective**

The main objective of this project is to design and develop a highly interactive, visually appealing web application that uses the capabilities of ChatGPT for generating different types of content. The content could range from Shayaris, Jokes, to Short Stories, etc.

##  **Ideas (choose anyone from this)**

** Joke Generator**

- Task: Develop an application that can create jokes using ChatGPT. The app should allow the user to specify the type of joke (e.g., knock-knock, light bulb, etc.).
- Skills involved: User input handling, frontend, backend, and ChatGPT integration.

## **Skills Required**

- Knowledge of Frontend (React.js, HTML/CSS) with a strong UI/UX design emphasis.
- Understanding of the Backend (Node.js)
- Basic understanding of APIs, REST, and CRUD operations.
- Familiarity with ChatGPT and how to use it in applications.

## Assignment **Description**

The application should be capable of generating different types of content based on user preference. The UI should be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, with high-level styling and animation. The backend can be built with Node.js, depending on your expertise and preference.

The central feature of the application should be the integration of ChatGPT. Users should be able to interact with the AI model and ask it to generate different types of content like Jokes. There should also be the ability to control the AI output's length, genre, or theme (if applicable) as part of the user's request.

## **Detailed Requirements**

### **1. Frontend**

- Use basic frontend using HTML/CSS and React for creating the UI.
- The UI should include options for users to choose the type of content they want to Jokes generate 
- Include customization options such as length, theme, genre, etc. if applicable.
- The app should be visually appealing and have smooth navigation. Use advanced CSS techniques for styling and animation to create a rich user experience.

### **2. Backend**

- You can use Node.js or Java for creating the server-side logic.
- It should manage user requests, process them, and interact with ChatGPT to generate the required content.
- Implement proper RESTful API architecture.

### **3.** ChatGPT **Integration**

- Integrate ChatGPT into the application for generating the content.
- It should be able to handle different types of content and any customizations included by the user.

### **4. Extras**

- Implement user authentication and allow users to save their favourite generated content.
- Allow sharing of the generated content on social media platforms.

## **Assessment**

Websites will be assessed based on their UI/UX design, functionality, integration of ChatGPT, and how well the backend handles requests and delivers responses. Bonus points for adding extra features and creative use of ChatGPT.
